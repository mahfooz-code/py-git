# Dulwich

**Dulwich** is a pure-Python implementation of Git, designed to work without requiring a native Git installation.

---

## 🚀 Overview

- **No external dependencies:** Works in environments where Git is not installed.
- **Flexible APIs:** Provides both low-level and high-level interfaces for interacting with Git repositories.
- **Performance:** Optional Rust bindings available for speed improvements.

---

## 🌟 Strengths

- **Ideal for restricted environments** (e.g., embedded systems, custom Python tooling).
- **Widely adopted:** Used by projects like Bazaar and Mercurial for Git interoperability.
- **Active ecosystem:** Over 33,000 dependent projects and 2.2k+ GitHub stars.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Performance:** Generally slower than alternatives like GitPython due to its pure Python nature.
- **Learning curve:** May require more effort to understand and use effectively compared to higher-level libraries.
